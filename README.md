# Collaborative AR Experience

This project creates an augmented reality experience where you can build a scene together with anyone around the world, seeing live updates from others.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- An Agora developer account (see [How To Get Started with Agora](https://www.agora.io/en/blog/how-to-get-started-with-agora?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=ios-rtm-ar))
- Xcode 11+
- iOS 14+ or macOS 11

To get started, download this repository, go into the `RTM-CollaboratAR` subdirectory and run `pod install` in the Terminal to get started.

You will need to change the placeholders in _RTM-CollaboratAR/Shared/AppKeys.swift_ to your Agora app ID and a temporary token for this project to work.
